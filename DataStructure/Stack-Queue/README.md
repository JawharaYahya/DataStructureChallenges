# **Stack and Queue Data Structure**

## A stack is a data structure that works by Last In, First Out (LIFO). It supports four main operations:

### **push(data)** to add an item to the top.
### **pop()** to remove the top item.
### **peek()** to view the top item without removing it.
### **isEmpty()** to check if the stack is empty.

## A queue is a data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first item added is the first one to be removed. It supports four main operations:

### **enqueue(data)** Adds a new element to the queue.
### **dequeue()** Removes and returns the first (front) element from the queue.
### **peek()** Returns front element in the queue without removing it.
### **isEmpty()** to check if the queue is empty.
